## What I'm Working On 🧑‍💻

I'm currently working on a project creating my own fitness force measuring device for climbing. [This project](https://github.com/human16/Pulling_project) incorporates Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology with a Raspberry Pi attached to the force sensing device, which communicates with a companion phone app written in Kotlin and KMP.
